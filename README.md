# godot-line-collider-2d
A collider that takes an array of Line2D as input and outputs a collision shape chain following the lines

## How to use
1. Put this script anywhere in the project
2. Attach this script to the bodies you want
3. Create a line anywhere in the scene (doesn't have to be shown) and use the built-in line tools to modify it
4. Expand the list in the exported variables list (on the right) to how many lines you want colliders for
5. Assign each node path to each line node

## TODO
Make the script work with rotation and scale
